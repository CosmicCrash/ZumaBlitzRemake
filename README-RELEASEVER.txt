Zuma Blitz Remake
==========

A preservation & recreation project for Zuma Blitz - an old Facebook game
from 2010-2017, specifically the Kroakatoa Island update.

Zuma Blitz was a Facebook game that used Adobe Flash, from 2010-2017. It
released on December 14, 2010. It then had a revamp in 2012, called
Kroakatoa Island, and was closed March 31, 2017.

This project is a collaborative effort in order for past Zuma Blitz players
to relive their 1-minute ball shooting memories.

==========

This is still in it's early development stages. Changes may occur, and there's
still a whole lot of features to implement, such as:
- Board Selector
- Powers Selector
- Food Selector
- Spirit Animal prompts
- Frogatars

Keep in mind that it's possible to change some of these values.

To change the board:
Currently, the available boards are:
- Journey to Kroakatoa
- Bronze Board (Bronze Age)
- Crab Board (Crab Snap)
- Roots Board (Back to your Roots)

- Double click on the games folder
- Double click on the ZumaBlitzRemake folder
- Double click on the config folder
- Open "level_set.json" with Notepad. If you do not see this please open the game and enter your name, and click on Close
- Find the number 101. Replace it with anything here below:
  - 101: Roots Board
  - 102: Bronze Board
  - 103: Journey to Kroakatoa
  - 104: Crab Board

To assign a Spirit Animal:
Make sure you already have a profile.

- Double click on the games folder
- Double click on the ZumaBlitzRemake folder
- Double click on "runtime.json"
- Scroll down until you're inside your profile:

  "selected": "YourName",
  "profiles": {
      "YourName": {
          ...
          "foodInventory": [],
          "monument": "eagle", <-- ADD IT HERE, it can be "eagle" or "turtle"
                                   MAKE SURE IT IS ENCAPSULATED IN QUOTES AND IT HAS
                                   A COMMA AFTER THAT
          "levels" {
              ...
          }
          ...
      }
  }

To stop using a Spirit Animal, simply remove the line that says "monument".

To assign Food:
Make sure you already have a profile.

- Double click on the games folder
- Double click on the ZumaBlitzRemake folder
- Double click on "runtime.json"
- Scroll down until you're inside your profile:

  "selected": "YourName",
  "profiles": {
      "YourName": {
          ...
          "foodInventory": [],
          "food": "curvy_fries", <-- ADD IT HERE, it can be in the valid values below:
                                     MAKE SURE IT IS ENCAPSULATED IN QUOTES AND IT HAS
                                     A COMMA AFTER THAT
          "levels" {
              ...
          }
          ...
      }
  }

Valid values:
- "cherry_time_tart"
- "chocolate_love"
- "curvy_fries"
- "kiwi_kebab"
- "10_pound_turkey"
- "chocolate_food" (note that increased shot speed only applies and it doesn't give a Candy Lei effect)

To stop using Food, simply remove the line that says "food".

To upgrade Powers:
Make sure you already have a profile.

- Double click on the games folder
- Double click on the ZumaBlitzRemake folder
- Double click on "runtime.json"
- Scroll down until you're inside your profile:

  "selected": "YourName",
  "profiles": {
      "YourName": {
          ...
          "equippedFood": "chocolate_love",
          "powerCatalog": {
              "bombs": {
                  "level": 3, <-- EDIT THIS
                  "amount": 0
              },
              "wild_shot": {
                  "level": 3, <--
                  "amount": 0
              },
              ...
          }
          ...
      }
  }

Each "key" (the label) has 2 fields: "level" and "amount". You will want
to edit "level". ("amount" isn't used yet)

All Powers have a level cap of 3, except "multi_multiplier" (Doubler/Tripler)
and "inferno_frog". Don't worry about overleveling them though, as the game
will take care of that for you.

To apply Powers:

- Double click on the games folder
- Double click on the ZumaBlitzRemake folder
- Double click on "runtime.json"
- Scroll down until you're inside your profile:

  "selected": "YourName",
  "profiles": {
      "YourName": {
          ...
          "foodInventory": [],
          "equippedPowers": [ "power_1", "power_2", "power_3" ], <-- ADD IT HERE
                                                                     MAKE SURE IT HAS A COMMA
                                                                     AFTER THAT
          "levels" {
              ...
          }
          ...
      }
  }

This takes an array of 0-3 strings (text). Make sure each entry is encapsulated
in quotation marks - and they are completely facing down "" quotation marks
and NOT curly ones such as these: “” or else the game won't read it and potentially
crash. Every entry must have a comma after them except the last one.

Each string must be a valid powerup (seen in powerCatalog). For example:
"equippedPowers": [ "multi_multiplier", "sands_of_time", "fruit_master" ]

This equips Doubler/Tripler, Sands of Time and Fruit Master.
