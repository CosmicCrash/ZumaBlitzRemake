# OpenSMCE
Open-source Sphere Matcher Community Engine - an engine that is made to run very various SM games.

The code runs on LOVE2D 11.3 and is executed by starting start.bat file.

It will not work on itself though - a game is required.

The engine runs games located in `games` folder - a converter will be available to be able to convert content made for the original Luxor/Luxor AR engine.

There is no game chooser yet - you can change the game name in parenthesis in main.lua:17.



This engine is on late alpha stage - there are some crucial features and fixes to be included before entering beta stage.

In current shape, it is intended to play Luxor game. Next steps will add support for Luxor Amun Rising, its huge variety of mods and Zuma respectively.

ETA of entering beta stage (original Luxor game fully working and playable): end of July 2020

Stay tuned!
