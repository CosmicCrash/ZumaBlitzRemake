> A preservation & recreation project for **Zuma Blitz** - an old Facebook game
from 2010-2017, specifically the *Kroakatoa Island* update

--------

**Zuma Blitz** was a Facebook game that used Adobe Flash, from 2010-2017. It
released on December 14, 2010. It then had a revamp in 2012, called
*Kroakatoa Island*, and was closed March 31, 2017.

This project is a collaborative effort in order for past Zuma Blitz players
to relive their 1-minute ball shooting memories.
